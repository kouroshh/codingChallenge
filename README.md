Given an array of length >= 0, and a positive integer N, return the contents of the array divided into N equally sized arrays. Where the size of the original array cannot be divided equally by N, the final part should have length equal to the remainder.

Example:
Inputs [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and 3
Output [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]]

By running "python unite_test.py" the test is running and also printing sample input-outputs.
The python version is 2.7
